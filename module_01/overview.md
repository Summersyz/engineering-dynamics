# Module 1 - Dynamic equations and definitions

In this course, we are focused on kinematic _geometry of
motion_ and kinetic _forces, energy, and impacts_
equations. This module covers the basic equations and
definitions for describing dynamic motion.

# Outline

1. Kinematics
  a. define position
  b. velocity 
  c. acceleration
  d. degrees of freedom and coordinates
2. Kinetics
  a. Newton-Euler equations
  b. Impulse-momentum
  c. Work-energy
  d. equations of motion = second order diff eq
3. Solving dynamic problem
  a. Newton-Euler equations define eom
  b. Use ODE solution for x(t)
