Focus on:
1. __Equation 4.2__ Impulse-Momentum equation

2. __Example 4.1__ Impulsive spring

3. __Definition 4.2 and Equation 4.7__ Angular momentum for of Newton's second law

4. __Example 4.3__ Calculating the angular momentum of a moving point mass

5. __Example 4.7__ Tetherball

6. __Equations 5.6 and 5.16 and Table 5.1__ Work-energy equation and potential energy

__Choose three examples and discuss how kinematics (specifically the transport
equation) were applied to describe the geometry of motion.__ Take a look at
what the rest of the class writes and add some discussion points on a
colleague's interpretation.
