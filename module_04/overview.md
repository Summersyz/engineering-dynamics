# Module 03 - Momentum and Energy

This module uses energy and momentum methods directly.

1. Energy and Momentum are different forms of Newton's
   second law
   a. Impulse-momentum is Fdt=dp
   b. Work-energy is Fdx=dT
   c. momentum is a vector
   d. energy is a scalar
2. Describes states of system
  a. Impulse happens over short time in impact
  b. energy in conservative system ia conserved
  c. combining methods can solve for state at point of
  interest
  d.
